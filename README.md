# Furniture_detection

### Introduction
This is a basic furniture detction model trained on pytorch resnet50 model with synthetic dataset generated with Unreal engine and annoatated with coco-annotator.

### How to run it?
To train the model, first clone the page in your terminal, then go to furniture detction:
```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sina2104/Furniture_detection)
   cd Furniture_detection
```
Then in the same directory download the dataset from [here](https://disk.yandex.ru/d/lCrNpgwHiHQhUQ).
Now check if you have all the python laboratories use and to train your model:
```shell
   python furniture_detection.py
```
In the same dataset you can directly download the already trained model.
To run the model you can use
```shell
   python run_detection.py
```
